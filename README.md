## User Interface

The project include a working and faithful user interface, with several widgets, all animated.

I designed the UI to be all event-driven by severals event dispatchers for all runes in order to isolate each system. 

## Demo Shrine

For testing purposes, a little Demo Shrine is included in the projet. The player must face challenges to collect one orb for each rune, showing that the mecanics are working correctly. 

## Disclaimer
The user interface uses the Nintendo Switch controller scheme.
