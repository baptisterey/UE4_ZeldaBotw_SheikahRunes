  <br><b>Recreation of the 4 Sheikah Runes mechanics from Zelda Breath of the Wild using the Unreal Engine 4 (V4.25.3).</b>
</p>


## Introduction

This project features :
* Four distinct Sheikah Runes (Remote Bombs, Cryonis, Stasis, Magnesis) working gameplay mechanics.
* Complete User Interfaces working like the full game for each rune.
* Basic melee combo system for interacting with stasis objects.
* A demo level in the form of an Shrine, where you can test the abilities in four rooms and collect orbs.

## Basic Interactions
<p align="center">
  <img src="./DemoRessources/CarryDropBomb.gif">
  <br><i>Link can carry and drop objects</i>
</p>

Those interactions are common for severals objects. 
For now Link can :
* Carry objects
* Drop objects
* Launch objects

The animation blueprint uses IK on both hands based on two sockets found in the object carried.

With the <b>Cryonis</b> rune, Link can create and destroy pillars on water surfaces. The system handles pillars created horinzontaly (from a cascade).

 With the <b>Magnetic</b> rune, Link can carry big magnetic objects. He can pull or push the objects.
 
## User Interface

The project include a working and faithful user interface, with several widgets, all animated.

I designed the UI to be all event-driven by severals event dispatchers in order to isolate each system. 

## Demo Shrine

For testing purposes, a little Demo Shrine is included in the projet. The player must face challenges to collect one orb for each rune, showing that the mecanics are working correctly.

## Work in Progress
* Add sound effects to the demo (I need to find some ressources online with the sounds from the game).

## Disclaimer
The user interface uses the Nintendo Switch controller scheme.
